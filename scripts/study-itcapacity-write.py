r"""study-itcapacity-write.py — the in-house capacity study's summaries, written from its facts.

    python scripts/study-itcapacity-write.py
    python scripts/study-itcapacity-write.py --dry

`maturity/documentation/maturity-study-method.md` §8, as `study-offsitebackup-write.py` does
it. **Nothing is composed here that a fact does not state**: each of the four paragraphs is
the drafters' own fact sentences on that aspect, each linked whole to its evidence row's
`url`, the rows that set the stage first, then the rest newest first while the paragraph stays
inside its room. An aspect with nothing found says so, linked to the fact that set the stage.

Writes, per country, `outputs/maturity/itcapacity/{ISO3}.md` and
`maturity/itcapacity/evidence/{ISO3}/short.json`. Run it after the ladder script.

Exit: 0 written, 2 the study cannot be read.
